zotero-classify-articles
========================

Zotero plugin to tag journal articles with discipline classification of journal in which article is published

## Description

This plugin searches for journal article items in a user's Zotero library. Each of these items should have a publication title, i.e. the journal in which the item was published. This title is matched against the plugin's list of publication titles. If a match is found, the item is tagged with the publication's discipline.

### Example

For instance, suppose the article *The European Security Strategy: Multilateral Security with Teeth?* is present in the user's Zotero library. This article was published in *Defense & Security Analysis* 21:3 (2005). This publication, according our plugin's database, belongs to the *Social Sciences* discipline, and the *Defense* subdiscipline. Thus, the item will be tagged with *Discipline: Social Sciences / Defense*

## Notes

The code was written to meet a deadline, and so could stand to be improved in many ways. Please contribute if you can.
